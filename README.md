# Password Generator

Website used to generate a random password based on the parameters set by the user.

## Overview

Based on the given Acceptance Criteria from the customer I was able to create a password generator. The user is first met with a large red button that says Generate Password. Upon clicking this button a series of prompts asks the user for their criteria. The criteria needed from the user includes length between 8-128 characters, and which of the following four types of characters they would like included in the password: lowercase, UPPERCASE, numbers and special characters. Once all of the criteria is given a random password is displayed on the screen for them to highlight and copy.
